# Architectural Invariants

Absolute invariants: rules that must always hold, with no legitimate exception.
Unlike the aspirational entries in `ARCHITECTURAL_GUIDELINES.md`, an invariant
has no "Deviate when" clause, and any violation is a defect. Where an invariant
can be enforced mechanically, back it with a lint, hook, or test; this file is
the human-readable specification, not a replacement for those checks.

## Workflow integrity

### I-Gate-1: A gate never disarms on data authored by the gated entity

A hard gate (a size trigger, a publish gate, a safety check) must not be
suppressed, weakened, or disarmed solely by metadata that the gated entity
itself declared, such as a drafting model's self-reported `diff_added` or
`mechanical_churn`. Disarming a hard gate requires independently computed
evidence or an explicit operator decision recorded in run state. Self-declared
metadata may soften presentation, never the trigger condition. Evidence of
violation: a gate whose disarm inputs are all writable by the entity under
evaluation (#6542, #6524).

### I-Pause-1: A pause snapshot contains every artifact a resume guard reads

The /design pause snapshot must include every file and sentinel that any
resume-path guard or validator reads to corroborate prior progress, including
the `.completed/` step sentinels. When a guard gains a new required artifact,
the snapshot allowlist changes in the same commit. A resume that false-refuses
on an artifact the pause omitted is a defect of the snapshot, not of the guard
(#6548). Mechanical backing: the pause snapshot regression tests in
`python/tests/design/test_design_pause.py` cover `.completed/` inclusion;
extend them when the guard-read artifact set grows.
