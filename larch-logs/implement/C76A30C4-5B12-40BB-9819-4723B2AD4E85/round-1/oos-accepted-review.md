### FINDING_1: [OUT_OF_SCOPE] branch mixes Stage 3 with unrelated commits
- **Reviewer(s)**: cursor-specialist-structure-output.txt, cursor-specialist-correctness-output.txt, cursor-specialist-edge-cases-output.txt, cursor-specialist-plan-fidelity-output.txt
- **Severity**: important
- **Concern**: The branch combines Stage 3 work with unrelated `--trivial` removal and version/net-retry commits, making review, CI failures, traceability, and revert risk harder to reason about for a Stage 3-only merge.
- **Suggested revisions (informational for voters; coder decides)**:
  - From cursor-specialist-structure-output.txt: Address the concern above.
  - From cursor-specialist-correctness-output.txt: Address the concern above.
  - From cursor-specialist-edge-cases-output.txt: Address the concern above.
  - From cursor-specialist-plan-fidelity-output.txt: Address the concern above.

### FINDING_2: [OUT_OF_SCOPE] changelog still documents removed monitor behavior
- **Reviewer(s)**: cursor-specialist-structure-output.txt, cursor-specialist-correctness-output.txt, cursor-specialist-edge-cases-output.txt
- **Severity**: important
- **Concern**: `CHANGELOG.md` still describes #2826 sentinel/monitor behavior that Stage 3 removes, leaving release notes that contradict the shipped shim behavior.
- **Suggested revisions (informational for voters; coder decides)**:
  - From cursor-specialist-structure-output.txt: Address the concern above.
  - From cursor-specialist-correctness-output.txt: Address the concern above.
  - From cursor-specialist-edge-cases-output.txt: Address the concern above.
